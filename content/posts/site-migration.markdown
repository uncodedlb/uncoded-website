We host regular social events at which attendees can form new contacts, receive advice on job-hunting, and geek out on everything from open-source software to hydroponics to 3D printing.

## Mission

To create and inspire a passionate, sharing, and inventive local tech culture through open, inclusive engagement with our community.

## Vision

We imagine a city where community life goes hand-in-hand with technology, and where people freely share ideas and software.
