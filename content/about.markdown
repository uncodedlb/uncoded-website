# About

Since 2015, Uncoded has fostered community spirit among technology professionals and enthusiasts in Long Beach, CA. We host regular social events at which attendees can form new contacts, receive advice on job-hunting, and geek out on everything from open-source software to hydroponics to 3D printing.

## Mission

To create and inspire a passionate, sharing, and inventive local tech culture through open, inclusive engagement with our community.

## Vision

We imagine a city where community life goes hand-in-hand with technology, and where people freely share ideas and software.

# Our Pillars

## Advocacy

Engage with civic, community, and business institutions to win their support for, and commitment to, our thriving tech community.

## Business

Encourage local businesses to provide speakers, venues, and sponsorship to support our programs. Give back to businesses by taking their hiring needs into account while educating members of the community.

## Community and Networking

Run technology-centric events which create bonds between leaders and volunteers in technology. Help the Long Beach tech community grow while integrating it into the city as a whole.

# Active Initiatives

## Hack Nights

A weekly event, and our most popular one. Anyone involved in technology or passionate about it is encouraged to attend, regardless of skill level. At Hack Nights, we share with one another, that we may all learn from our peers. Hack Nights begin with introductions and sharing, then morph into working and socializing sessions.
